## Background of App

So i've been working as a Business Systems Analyst at [Nice House of Plastics](https://www.nice.co.ug/) for a few months now. One of my smallest challenges was to memorize the names of Our Best Selling Chairs. i.e All Size Vs Portable. It's not a big problem but why not?

### Solution üíΩ

I wanted my Solution to be Simple & Fast. So i decided to work on a machine learning model and serve it through a Mobile Application. So i could always take a pic with my Phone's Camera and get the Prediction.

### How ? ‚òÑÔ∏è

To train a model, you need a lot of training data, say 1000 for each chair. The obvious method would have been to take a lot of pictures on my phone and use them as training data. After taking about 10 Pics, i realized there has to be a better way:-

-   Record a 2 Min Video of each Chair on My Phone.
-   Open the Video in Photoshop and Export each Frame of the Video as an Image
-   Use tensor flow the modeling.
-   Flutter for the Mobile Application.

### Anhaa!! ü§î

The Question still remains?? Does it work?

### Conclusion !

Am no expert on Machine Learning and i don't think this is the best way to do it, but it works.

You can also get yourself One of Our Chairs and Test this Application.

### What Next 

Am thinking of training a model that can do predictions on all Our Products and may be a mini recommendation engine on Our Website.
