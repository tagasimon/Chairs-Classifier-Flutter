## Background of App

So i've been working as a Business Systems Analyst at [Nice House of Plastics](https://www.nice.co.ug/) for a few months now. One of my smallest challenges was to memorize the names of Our Best Selling Chairs. i.e All Size Vs Portable. It's not a big problem but so is Dog Vs CatüòÇüòÇ

### Solution üíΩ

I wanted my Solution to be Simple & Fast. So i decided to work on a machine learning model and serve it through a Mobile Application. So i could always take a pic with my Phone's Camera and get the Prediction. i.e Easy & Fast.

### How ? ‚òÑÔ∏è

To train a model, you need a lot of training data, say 1000 for each chair. The obvious method would have been to take a lot of pictures on my phone and use them as training data. After taking 10 Pics, i realized there has to be a better way:-

-   Record a 2 Min Video of each Chair on My Phone.
-   Go to PhotoShop and Export each Frame of the Video as an Image
-   Problem Solved.

The App is a Simple and Done with Flutter, Probably the Best Tool if you want to get into Mobile Development.
